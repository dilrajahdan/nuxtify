      You have extensive expertise in Vue 3, Nuxt 3, TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue Router, Pinia, VueUse, Vuetify 3 for UI, Supabase for authentication and database (PostgreSQL @nuxtjs/supabase module). You possess a deep knowledge of best practices and performance optimization techniques across these technologies.

      Core Principles:
      - Keep It Simple: Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity
      - Write Defensive Code: Handle errors gracefully without complex error management
      - Minimal TypeScript: Use TypeScript for basic type safety without going overboard
      - Practical Over Perfect: Focus on working solutions rather than theoretical perfection
      - Data First: Prioritize efficient data fetching and state management

      Code Style and Structure
      - Write clean, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code.
      - Prioritize functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid using classes.
      - Emphasize iteration and modularization to follow DRY principles and minimize code duplication.
      - Prefer Composition API <script setup> style.
      - Use Composables only when they genuinely simplify code reuse
      - Add types to /types directory
      - Use and update Vuetify.ts for styling Vuetify components
      - Put Global styles in /assets/styles/tokens.css

      Data Fetching Best Practices:
      - Use useFetch as the primary data fetching tool
        - For SSR and automatic caching: useFetch('/api/data')
        - For client-only fetching: useFetch('/api/data', { server: false })
        - For lazy loading: useFetch('/api/data', { lazy: true })
      - Use $fetch for one-off client-side requests (e.g., in event handlers)
      - Use useAsyncData for complex data fetching scenarios
      - Implement proper loading and error states for all data fetching
      - Use watch with immediate: true for reactive data fetching
      - Cache responses when beneficial using Nuxt's built-in caching

      State Management
      - Use Pinia only for truly global state
      - Keep store structure simple
      - Prefer component-level state when possible
      - Use @pinia-plugin-persistedstate/nuxt for state persistence
        - Configure persistence per store module
        - Use sessionStorage for sensitive data
        - Use localStorage for user preferences
        - Implement proper state rehydration

      Nuxt 3 Specifics
      - Nuxt 3 provides auto imports, so theres no need to manually import 'ref', 'useState', or 'useRouter'.
      - For color mode handling, use the built-in '@nuxtjs/color-mode' with the 'useColorMode()' function.
      - Use VueUse functions only for common, well-tested utilities
      - Use the Server API (within the server/api directory) to handle server-side operations like database interactions, authentication, or processing sensitive data that must remain confidential.
      - use useRuntimeConfig to access and manage runtime configuration variables that differ between environments and are needed both on the server and client sides.
      - For SEO use useHead and useSeoMeta.

      Naming Conventions
      - Use **PascalCase** for component file names (e.g., components/MyComponent.vue)
      - Use **kebab-case** for routes (e.g., pages/contact-us.vue)
      - Use **camelCase** for variables and functions
      - Prefix composables with 'use' (e.g., useAuth)

      TypeScript Usage
      - Use TypeScript primarily for basic prop types and function signatures
      - Keep types simple and straightforward
      - Avoid complex type manipulations
      - Use 'any' when TypeScript becomes more trouble than it's worth

      UI and Styling
      - Use Vuetify 3 for UI components
      - Create a vuetify.js configuration file with a custom theme
      - Implement responsive design with a mobile-first approach (useDisplay)
      - Keep styling consistent across components
      - Use Vuetify's built-in spacing and layout utilities

      Page and Layout Structure
      - Create a default.vue in layouts directory for main layout
      - Create index.vue in pages directory for home page
      - Organize components by feature/module in components directory
      - Use dynamic imports for lazy loading large components
      - Keep component hierarchy shallow (max 3 levels deep)

      Additional Best Practices:
      - Error Handling
        - Handle errors at the component level where they occur
        - Use try/catch with simple error messages
        - Focus on user experience over technical perfection

      - State Management
        - Use Pinia only for truly global state
        - Keep store structure simple
        - Prefer component-level state when possible
        - Use localStorage for simple persistence needs

      Authentication & Authorization
      - Implement middleware for route protection
      - Use Supabase for authentication (@nuxtjs/supabase module)
      - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)

      Testing
      - Write unit tests for critical business logic
      - Use Vitest for unit testing
      - Use Cypress for E2E testing of key user flows
      - Focus on testing user interactions and critical paths
      - Test error handling and edge cases

      Performance
      - Implement lazy loading for routes and large components
      - Use proper asset optimization (images, fonts)
      - Implement caching where beneficial
      - Monitor and optimize bundle size
      - Use WebP images with fallbacks

      Security
      - Use environment variables for sensitive data
      - Implement rate limiting on API routes
      - Keep dependencies updated
      - Validate all user inputs
      - Use HTTPS in production

      Accessibility
      - Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
      - Implement proper ARIA attributes
      - Ensure keyboard navigation
      - Maintain proper color contrast
      - Test with screen readers

      Internationalization
      - Use @nuxtjs/i18n for translations
      - Implement RTL support where needed
      - Use number and date formatting
      - Keep translations in separate files

      Deployment
      - Use Digital Ocean for deployment
      - Set up Github Actions for CI/CD
      - Implement automated testing in pipeline
      - Use staging environment for testing
      - Monitor application performance


Here's a step-by-step summary of how to implement E2E testing for Vue/Nuxt applications based on the transcript:

Initial Setup

bashCopy# Install required packages
npm install -D @nuxt/test-utils vitest @vue/test-utils happy-dom @playwright/core

Create Test Directory Structure


Create an e2e folder
Add test files with .test.ts extension (e.g., app.test.ts)


Basic HTML Testing Approach

typescriptCopyimport { setup, $fetch } from '@nuxt/test-utils/e2e'

describe('App', async () => {
  await setup()
  
  it('contains number as string', async () => {
    const html = await $fetch('/')
    expect(html).toContain('number')
  })
})

Advanced Browser Testing with Playwright

typescriptCopyimport { setup, createPage, url } from '@nuxt/test-utils/e2e'

describe('App', async () => {
  await setup()

  it('tests number generation', async () => {
    // Create a page instance
    const page = await createPage()
    
    // Navigate to the app
    await page.goto(url('/'))
    
    // Wait for hydration
    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')
    
    // Get content and run assertions
    const numberText = await page.textContent('span')
    const number = Number(numberText)
    expect(number).toBeGreaterThan(0)
    
    // Test interactions
    await page.click('button')
    const newNumberText = await page.textContent('span')
    expect(newNumberText).not.toBe(numberText)
  })
})

Important Testing Considerations


Use await setup() to properly initialize the Nuxt instance
Always wait for page hydration before testing
Use meaningful selectors (preferably data-test-ids)
Verify both positive and negative test cases
Ensure tests can fail appropriately


Additional Setup Requirements


Ensure Playwright browsers are installed:

bashCopynpx playwright install chromium

Best Practices

Use page.waitForLoadState('networkidle') before testing
Structure tests logically (setup, action, assertion)
Test real user interactions rather than implementation details
Use meaningful test descriptions that explain the expected behavior
